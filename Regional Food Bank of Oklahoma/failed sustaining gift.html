Dear [[S1:first_name]],
<br><br>
I'm writing to let you know we encountered a problem when we attempted to process the automatic payment of your next scheduled <strong>Friends at the Table</strong> gift.
<br><br>
If you wish to continue these regular gifts as part of the <strong>Friends at the Table</strong> program, please contact Melodie Shannon at the Regional Food Bank at 405-600-3136 so we can sort out the problem together. You can also update your payment method in your <a href="https://secure3.convio.net/rfbo/site/SPageNavigator/GiftServiceCenter.html">Gift Service Center</a>.
<br><br>
Thank you so much for being part of the <strong>Friends at the Table</strong> team! We look forward to hearing from you very soon.
<br><br>
With gratitude,<br />
